# RPPG
This repository consists on getting pule rate via a camera using OpenCV, some mathematics understanding and Image processing algorithms.
# Requirement
 Visual Studio 2019 or above
 OpenCV 4.5.1 or above (I used 4.5.1)
 
 # Instruction 
 You will first check the position of your camera in this line of code  :
                            VideoCapture cap(0); // open the default camera for my case it is 0
 You will need then to change the path of OpenCV of Visual Studio in your machine, then press run. 
 
 To get the pulse rate click on Open, and try not to move for a couple of secondes.
 Feel free to send me a message if you have any issue. I will be more than happy to help you.
 
 Since this code work on the brightness of the image, you will need maybe to fix one param named Pe. for my face I used 0.055.
